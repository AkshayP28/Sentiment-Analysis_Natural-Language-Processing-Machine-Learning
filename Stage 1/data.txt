- The book delivered is not a genuine product rather a photocopied bundle of the original.
- I Had a made a Big Mistake in purchasing this product.
- Product is defective. Their email address is fake or not active. Do not buy unless you are looking for spare parts.
- This book was. HUGE disappointment. The story itself had potential, but it was written very poorly.
- Duplicate product sent by seller, dont buy this with this seller, returned as soon as i got it, very low sound.
- quality is worst, feel like some local brand, it wont cover full ear it as small in size, sound effect is null.
- really the sound is very annoying totally not satisfy with product sound quality.
- not great sound effects for the tag JBL.
- This is a CRAP product from JBL.
- Low speed on sd card - its not so good as per the price.
- Book delivered on time but paper quality is very bad as compared to past editions.
- The second sim card slot for the phone I received is sealed shut. I can't get it opened and the main reason I bought this phone is for its dual sim capability and good reviews. So upset.
- I'm very very very disappointed that it does not have a memory card slot.
- This device doesn't support 4G LTE outside the U.S. - Do not buy it if you are going to use it outside the United States.
- Ambient light sensor is absent. This makes the life difficult when we intend to see the caller while we are outdoors. 
- they don't last very long.
- i used only two months after that one side of the ear hone got failed to work i dont know why it occur very bad product in the same way sony did but after one year use only.
- keys are stiff. I am having hard time coding on this. If you are a code don't buy this! I repeat. DON'T BUY THIS!!
- This pen drive is so delicate that its tips have broken within 2 months of use.
- bottom sole is not that much good as you would expect in around 3K rupee shoes.
- Not very good. not good looking.
- when it comes to gaming, it sucks big time here. There was frame drops and lag with almost all games.
- Few issues that I have noticed is that Camera is not good. Though it is 13 MP, the picture clarity is poor, getting blurred pictures. Does not auto focus properly resulting into blurred pics.
- Battery charging takes long time. Heats up when in use. Today I noticed that hearing volume has dropped. Unable to hear properly even after keeping high volume. Not very satisfied with this phone.
- Since receiving this handset in the morning hours of 18. 02. 2016, I have kept the handset for charging, but it is not getting charged even after keeping it on for more than 24 hours now. Its Battery is showing charged only at 2%, right from the beginning when I switched on the new handset today morning.
- I face problem with sd card. I really like the product and looks cool. I get an pop up error "SD card is removed while it is set as primary storage. It may cause system or some app exception!
- Phone good with Thetermax technology but very bad with camera. Todays date Camera is a very much need to take shots on travels and all. But this camera at 13 MP is very bad than my Xioami redmi 8 mp camera.
- Suddenly phone is showing some Chinese symbols and got struck, I cant even allow me to restart/switch off the mobile to get back to normal mode. then I waited till battery dead after that it got switched off. It was really a painful process to get back it as normal mode from this Chinese command prompt mode.
- Very bad experience, after few days of receive the product its showing lots problem like, hanging problem, whenever i'll open contact its showing loading to open and taking lots of time to open again and again...please replace or refund soon ,I'm fedup with this.
- Back Camera is worst, when you click photo at night then your face will be visible yellow due to yellow led flash. 
- Having used other Sennheiser headphones in the past, this has the worst sound quality. The sound is so sharp and there is near zero bass. I opened the original packing, requesting amazon to take a return. Let's see.
- I received these earphones today expecting them to be awesome but just after using them for like 15 minutes my ears were in so much pain even though I was playing the music on low volume! I gave them to my brother and my friend to try them out and they said their ears were hurting as well after 15-20 mins. I am extremely disappointed.
- I bought this a couple of weeks ago and I regret it. After reading the reviews I thought it was a good deal for the price but it isn't . The sound on this one hurts my ear. I would suggest shelling out some more and get a decent set of headphones. This works alright for speech but for music it's a complete no-no.
- Bought the headphone almost 2 months ago!! its already damaged.. and more over the customer service is terrible. 
- i have purchased this and after 4 months it's not working properly .... Only one side speaker works and other side not working what's this nonsense
- Its pathetic... Wire worns out..breaks and ends up playing either one...don't buy if u can't handle it well.
- i GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH IMAGE POSTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT I WILL GET MICRO SD CARD ADAPTER ALSO AS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE. BUT WHEN I OPENED MY PACKET, IT WAS MISSING.
- i have buy this memory card but they deliverd a damaged product.. and not good delivelery as well.. they deliverd in 1 week..I am very disappointed to purchase this card. it is got waste and not working any more. I don't know why.
- After a month it started hanging, card is their in phone but memory shows full and does not download even a single photo however there is 4 GB memory space. Not good.
- I'm very sorry to complain you that SanDisk 32gb memory card had damaged and not at all working from 15days. I wish I would replace by new product.
- Its deceptively heavy & big as opposed to pictures on the site.
- The cable to charge the power bank is not working already. Just about a month since purchase :(
- Worst product. I should say worst seller. Plz dont buy any product from this seller. They say their power bank are made to charge mobile so dongle wont work with it. Fools.
- Please don't buy this product no matter how well it looks. Its a duplicate power bank because it stopped working after 2 months. Which is really unacceptable.
- Poor Quality.. Gets switched off automatically in charging mode.
- Received Damaged product. Scratches on product like used product. It's not new.
- Not as expected.
- Not a good product.
- Touchscreen was faulty. Consequently have to go to service centre and replace within first month.
- The battery is draining fast, It gets switched on only when it is connected to the power. I think they had shipped me a old battery.
- This is one of the worst products I have bought from Amazon. The product is not even 2 month old and it's hanging up frequently.
- This is not a HTC phone, it is just a cheap chinese piece with all chinese parts, this phone is made for the specs to look attractive but every part of it is cheap.
- Even though it is octa-core processor, the phone lags, it takes more than a second to show caller ID while you get a caller ID (until then it shows blank screen).
- A hopeless product from htc, biggest drawback is the sound and sound quality, external speaker of the phone is disgusting, within 1 month from the purchase date phone started creating issues.
- Mobile is good w.r.t. performance & looks but camera quality is much poor compared to my earlier Samsung Galaxy grand. But I expect HTC to be sturdier than Samsung which was main reason for change.
- Please don't Buy dis phone touch screen will not work after 3 months HTC customer service centre is damn bad they will keep the mobile for 1 month an d again the same problem will a raise they kept my phone 2 months and changed the display 2 times never prefer HTC at any cost.
- First week was better. Bt nw it is hanging and heating up.
- I dont like this phone so much because it has china software system. Its notification bar and call keypad are similar to the micromax and karbonn or any other china phone like.
- I thought this is a good mobile. but am unsatisfied with this.. I am using this from past 4 months. and now there is some complaints in display. so don't buy this.
- Battery life is not good not working for 1 hours also
- Not worthy at all..sound output is really very disappointing. Rest found nothing special about this model. You should go for other brans like sony or apple.
- Its camera quality is not good,in day light its picture quality is ok but in dark light its picture quality is very bad(fogy).
- Camera quality isn't that good.. Also very slow processor!!
- Lags a lot! Disappointed hardly used it for 2 months and selling it off.
- Low sound. Slow processing leads to irritation.
- Performance No good, as repeated problems within warranty period.. Need to run around for rectifying it !
- Headphone sound is very poor.
- The worst phone I have ever used. The dialer and contacts apps hang always. To open a call history or search for a contact I need to wait for around 30 seconds. 
+ The product is good
